A blockchain based musical instrument management web app

Identification and verification of musical instruments in the music industry has not been
managed securely using better technology. The registration of most musical brands such as
Fender, Gibson and PRS have started in the early 90’s using databases which still has no solution
for the cheap knockoffs produced and sold in the market fooling many customers.

Through my proposed blockchain based musical instrument management web app will provide a
secure platform for all the high valued musical instruments to be stored and secured in the
blockchain and be located and identified by correct data of the owner. Not just identification but
this webapp will allow the process of transferring or purchasing of these good more securely
with a lower transaction fee and a good speed of the process through the web app.


The productive usage of blockchain in the music industry have been estabilished just like other
domains bringing out wonderful models of ideas and research, with very helpful outputs such as
music copyright licensing and NFT’s. As of now there is no proposed idea or any related
research to a concept of registering these highly valuable musical instruments in a blockchain
based webapp where there is also the possiblility of transferring the ownership and idenfication.
The closest to the idea that I proposed is the trading system based on blockchain(Wang, 2019)
for Arts which still does not have the features that are proposed by this(playerschain) blockchain
based webapp. However the the purpose that this system will provide will be unique and very
helpful to musicians and well renowed music brands to have their quality and standards.
