A blockchain based musical instrument management web app

Identification and verification of musical instruments in the music industry has not been
managed securely using better technology. The registration of most musical brands such as
Fender, Gibson and PRS have started in the early 90â€™s using databases which still has no solution
for the cheap knockoffs produced and sold in the market fooling many customers.

Through my proposed blockchain based musical instrument management web app will provide a
secure platform for all the high valued musical instruments to be stored and secured in the
blockchain and be located and identified by correct data of the owner. Not just identification but
this webapp will allow the process of transferring or purchasing of these good more securely
with a lower transaction fee and a good speed of the process through the web app.
